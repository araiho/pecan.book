### Getting Started: Background

The quickest way to get started is to download the virtual machine. The demo provides instructions to get started on your own machine. 
 * [Download Virtual Machine](http://isda.ncsa.illinois.edu/download/minimal.php?project=PEcAn&category=vm) and optionally convert VM to [[Desktop Machine | VM-Desktop-Conversion]]
 * [Work through Demo](http://pecanproject.github.io/tutorials.html)

### Site-level Runs

The most basic function of PEcAn is to make it easier to run models at different sites and evaluate their outputs. The [Demo](http://pecanproject.github.io/tutorials.html) describes the basics of running the model at an existing site. The following links walk through not only this, but also how to set up new sites and new model inputs so that you can extend PEcAn to your own research.

* [[Choose a site]]
* [[Choose a model]]
* [[Choosing meteorology]]
* [[Choosing PFTs]]
* [[Choosing initial vegetation]]
* [[Choosing soils]]

### Additional PEcAn Modules and Tools

### Supported Models

The following is a list of supported models. See [[Adding an Ecosystem Model]] for info on how to add new models to the system and don't hesitate to contact us if you need help. That said, the PEcAn team is not experts in all the models linked to PEcAn, so if there are issues with models themselves you would be encouraged to contact the original modeling teams.
