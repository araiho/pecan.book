## Updating BETY database

A new system is in place which will allow you to update the BETY database without loosing any local changes (this is still BETA though). To update the datbase and keep your changes, all you have to do is run the following:

```
cd
pecan/scripts/load.bety.sh
```

## Update the Rails app and schema

If you have an instance of BETY and you might want to update it to the latest version at certain points for the following reasons.
- security updates
- new functionality
- importing data and remote server has newer version

To update BETY you can use the following steps to update your system (this is assuming the VM, if you installed BETY in another location please change the path accordingly). This requires the development version of ruby.

```bash
sudo -s
# change to BETY
cd /usr/local/bety
# update BETY to latest version
git pull
# install all required gems
bundle install --without test_js
# update database
rake db:migrate ï»¿RAILS_ENV="production"
# restart BETY
touch tmp/restart.txt
```

At this point your database should have migrated to the latest version and the BETY application should have restarted.

## Load a fresh version of database

This will overwrite your existing database; quick and easy way to set up system for development

```
./scripts/update.psql.sh
```
