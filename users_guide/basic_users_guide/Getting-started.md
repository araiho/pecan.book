### Background / Overview

Ecosystem models simulate the biology, physics, and chemistry of a system and interactions within the environment.

PEcAn provides an interface to a variety of ecosystem models and attempts to standardize and automate the processes of model parameterization, execution, and analysis. First, you choose an ecosystem model, then the time and location of interest (a site), and the plant community (or crop) that you are interested in simulating. All of these are set in a "settings" file, commonly named `pecan.xml`. 
To run the model forward in time requires information about the soil and a time series of weather. 

PEcAn is built to provide a common interface for these steps as well as executing model runs and summarizing the output in a unified format. 

Based on the settings, PEcAn reads in plant trait data, weather data, and soil data from an underlying database and the files or remote data providers. Then it converts these into the configuration and weather files required by a specific model. Some models use configuration files named `config.xml` or similar, but these are different and automatically generated by PEcAn. The key is that PEcAn uses models as-is, and all of the translation steps are done within PEcAn so no modifications are required of the model itself.

There are two ways of using PEcAn, via the web interface and directly within R. Even for users familar with R, using the web interface is a good place to start because it provides a high level overview of the PEcAn workflow.

<!--can add figures of the web interface and workflow here-->

The basic workflow in R is:



### Quick Start

The quickest way to get started is to download the virtual machine. The demo provides instructions to get started on your own machine. 
 * [Download Virtual Machine](http://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/projects/artifacts.php?key=PECAN) 
 * [Work through Demo](http://pecanproject.github.io/tutorials.html)

### Using PEcAn

#### Site-level Runs
The most basic function of PEcAn is to make it easier to run models at different sites and evaluate their outputs. The [Demo](http://pecanproject.github.io/tutorials.html) describes the basics of running the model at an existing site. The following links walk through not only this, but also how to set up new sites and new model inputs so that you can extend PEcAn to your own research.

* [[Choose a site]]
* [[Choose a model]]
* [[Choosing meteorology]]
* [[Choosing PFTs]]
* [[Choosing initial vegetation]]
* [[Choosing soils]]

### Supported Models

The following is a list of supported models. See [Adding an Ecosystem Model]( for info on how to add new models to the system and don't hesitate to contact us if you need help. That said, the PEcAn team is not experts in all the models linked to PEcAn, so if there are issues with models themselves you would be encouraged to contact the original modeling teams.

* [Ecosystem Demography model](https://github.com/EDmodel/ED2)
* [SIPNET](http://thesipnetmodel.blogspot.com/)
* [DALEC](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/mwilliam/DALEC.html)
* [BioCro](https://github.com/ebimodeling/biocro)
* [LINKAGES](http://daac.ornl.gov/MODELS/guides/LINKAGES.html)
