The [models/template](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/tree/master/models/template) package should provide a generic instruction for adding a new template, with example functions. An out-of-date draft of these instructions is located in the model template package [README](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/blob/master/models/template/README.Rmd) file.
