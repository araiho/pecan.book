# Does my study site already exist in PEcAn?

1. **Find the site on the map** The simplest way of determining if a site exists in PEcAn is through the Google Map interface of the web-based workflow. You'll want to make sure that the Host is set to All Sites and the Model is set to All Models. 

2. **Find the site in BETY** If the site is not on the map there's a chance that it still in the PEcAn but just lacking geographic information. To begin you'll want to login to your local version of the BETY database. If you're on the PEcAn VM this will be at localhost:3280/bety or localhost:6480/bety depending on whether you downloaded the 32 or 64 bit version.  Within BETY navigate to Data > Sites and use the Search window on the page to try and locate your site. If you *DO* find your site you will want to click Edit and add geographic information so that the site will show up on the map. It is also worth noting that the site ID number shows up in the URL for the Show or Edit pages after sites/. This ID is frequently useful to know, for example if you have to set up a PEcAn settings file by hand. If you did not find you site you will want to follow the instructions below for adding a site
